Project Documentation: FoodPanda Database Design and SQL's Queries Practice

Introduction:
This project aims to design and implement a comprehensive database system for managing food delivery services. This documentation outlines the structure, design decisions, and implementation details of the FoodPanda database. Additionally, it highlights the SQL practice undertaken during the project, including participation in HackerRank challenges resulting in the acquisition of Basic and Intermediate certificates.

ERD Design:
The Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) serves as the foundation for the FoodPanda database design. It visually represents the entities, their attributes, and the relationships between them. 

MySQL Database Implementation:
The FoodPanda database is implemented using MySQL Data Definition Language (DDL) commands. These commands define the structure of the database, including tables, columns, keys, and constraints.

SQL Practice and HackerRank Certificates:
During the development of this project, SQL practice sessions were conducted using HackerRank challenges. These challenges provided opportunities to enhance SQL skills and solve real-world problems. I successfully completed both Basic and Intermediate challenges, earning certificates to validate their proficiency.

Conclusion:
This project demonstrates the application of database design principles and SQL skills in developing a comprehensive food delivery database system. By creating an ERD, implementing the database using MySQL commands, and participating in SQL practice sessions on HackerRank, I have gained valuable experience and proficiency in database management and SQL querying. The FoodPanda database is poised to facilitate efficient food delivery services, benefiting both customers and restaurants.
